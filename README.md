# FRC-Visualizer
Visualizer for FRC robot data.

Uses springboot and maven to host a web server to pull and visualize FRC robot locations on the field based on encoders and apriltags.
Feel free to use if you want, but it's honestly probably easier/better/faster to make your own given that this isn't actively maintained or documented, and we don't really know what wer're doing.
